# **COVID-19 Alert System (CAS)**

A lightweight, customizable tool for a facility to submit a daily report on the number of individuals who show symptoms (or have been tested) for COVID-19. The facility can also request PPE equipment, signal needs, and get support.

## [Demo the tool here.](https://builtforzero.github.io/cas-submission-tool/)

This tool is based on the Symptom Alert System for Shelters (SASS) developed by the [Minnesota Heading Home Alliance](https://headinghomealliance.com/symptom-alert-system-for-shelters-sass/).
